        <h3> The first steps of building a computer is going to be the parts you need to put together your computer. 
            You'll need: A screwdriver and screws, some thermal paste, a motherboard, ram sticks (recommend two 8gb sticks at least), a GPU(Graphics Card) compatiable with your motherboard and case (optional if your motherboard has graphics integrated), 
            a power supply that is compatable with your motherboard,  a hard drive and/or a SSD drive, some cooling fans, a cpu (recommend at least an i5 or a ryzen 5), 
            and a cpu fan compatiable with your cpu

                Start by looking at the manual that comes with your case figure out where to place your motherboard. Insert your motherboard carefully then screw it into place. 
                Next find your hard drive bay and insert your hard drive into one of the slots. If you have a SSD drive you would insert it in place of the hard drive. 
                Take the SATA cable from the motherboard and connect it to your hard drive or SSD drive.

                Locate where your power supply should stay, if need be look at the manual that came with your case. 
                After the power supply is inserted connect the 24 pin connector to the corresponding slot in the motherboard and the PCI-E cable into the motherboard
                to provide power for the CPU. Also connect the power supply to the hard drive or SSD drive.

                    Take your new processor from its protective bag, grip by the edges and avoid touching pins or contacts. Line up your processor with the motherboard's socket; depending on the
                    processor and socket you use, you could have notches around the edges or a small triangle in the corners of your CPU. Gently lay the processor on the socket, NEVER force the 
                    processor into place, or apply pressure to the CPU. If you do it may bend or break the pins, if broken the CPU becomes inoperable. Close the socket cover and relatch it so the CPU
                    is held in place.

                        First you will need to insert your CPU fan on top of your CPU. Apply a thin layer of thermal paste on top of the CPU. Line up the fans mounting pins with the CPU 
                        and place it directly on top of the CPU and hold it there while you reattach the mounting pins with your screwdriver (This process could change based on the type of CPU fan you get
                        , always look at the manual to double check). Plug in the CPU fan into the motherboard's CPU fan port for power. After the CPU fan is done its time to insert our other fans 
                        into the spots designated in the case (check the manual assigned with your case). Connect these fans directly to your power supply after insertion.

                            The slots where the RAM sticks go usually have locks on both sides, detach these locks by just applying a bit of pressure to them. Insert your RAM sticks carefully into the slot
                            applying a bit of pressure until you hear it click into place. After the click relock the slots so the sticks won't go anywhere. Most cases on the back have slots for the 
                            GPU to stick out. You will need to unscrew these with your screwdriver, after this is done there should be a docking slot for your GPU to reside
                            (Check motherboard manual for locaton if need be). Insert the GPU into the slot after unlatching the similar locks with the RAM sticks (this might be optional depending on the motherboard) 
                            apply a bit of pressure until you hear that click sound then relatch the locks if applicable. After it is latched into place connect your GPU to the power supply using a PCI-E cable to
                            give it power. Once done rescrew the back slot on the case where your graphics card pans out into the case to insure that card does not go anywhere.

                                is to purchase and install your operating system to your computer. Insert the disc and boot it up for the installation to begin!
